## Description

The **OmniVista Smart Tool (OST)** is a free, field-ready companion app designed to simplify the deployment, configuration, and troubleshooting of **ALE switches** in OT environments.
Unlike cloud-managed platforms, OST delivers a **standalone, on-site utility** that empowers entry-level technicians to install and maintain **ALE switches** in under an hour — reducing support load, accelerating partner onboarding, and improving customer retention.

## Distribution

OST is distributed as a single installer package:

`OmniVista-SmartTool-Setup-vx.x.x.msi`

Users simply install the MSI and start the application.

## Key Features

- 🚀 **Simple Setup** – Wizard-based configuration, no CLI, no console cables, no prior training required
- 🔌 **PoE Diagnostics** – Verify every device, resolve common PoE issues, check budgets, automate TAC troubleshooting
- 📡 **Cable & Device Tools** – Built-in TDR for cable health, per-port LLDP device and power data
- 🛠 **Field-Ready Utilities** – One-click repair, outdated software warnings, auto-save of all changes
- 💾 **Backup & Restore** – Easy one-time switch backup/restore for RMA swaps or emergencies
- 🔒 **Secure & Expandable** – Customizable without modifying AOS

## Why OmniVista Smart Tool?

- Reduces dependency on CLI
- Trains new installers quickly
- Minimizes downtime in high-turnover environments
- Provides **rapid, reliable switch configuration on any ALE switch**

## Configuration & Logs

User data is stored under `%AppData%\Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise\AOS Toolkit`:

- `Log\` → log files
- `app.cfg` → user configuration (theme, language, saved switches, password hash)

⚠️ The first-time password is hardcoded in `Data/Constants.cs (DEFAULT_PASS_CODE)`.
Once changed, the built-in password is no longer valid. To reset, delete `app.cfg`.
