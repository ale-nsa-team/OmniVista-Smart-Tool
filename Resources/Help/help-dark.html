    <p class="header">Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise Installer's Toolkit Help</p>
    <p>
        Power over Ethernet (PoE) is a technology that allows Ethernet cables to transmit both data and electrical power to devices over a single network cable. 
        This simplifies the installation of networked devices such as wireless access points, IP cameras, VoIP phones, and other network devices by eliminating 
        the need for separate power supplies.
        Before we start, the minimum AOS supported by this Wizard is 8.9 R1. Switches running AOS 5.X or 6.X are not supported.
        The Application attempts to diagnose and repair PoE devices that will not boot.

    <p id="connection" class="topic">Connecting to a Switch</p>
    <p> Start by clicking Connection at the upper left of the tool and select Switch.</p>
    <img src="connection.png" />
    <p>
        You will need the IP address of the ALE switch, username, and password.
        The default username is admin, and the default password is switch.  Both are lower case.
    </p>
    <img src="login.png" />
    <p>
        Upon successful completion of the login, the Application will gather important information about the switch 
        including the serial number, model, software release and more.
    </p>
    <img src="connected.png" />
    <p>
        The middle pane of the tool displays power supply information and status. It will also show the budget being allocated to PoE devices 
        as well if the switch supports the new 802.3bt PoE standard and options for Fast PoE and Perpetual PoE. 
        You can also perform some actions such as turn PoE on and off on a slot and enable / disable fast PoE or perpetual PoE.
    </p>
    <p class="no-space">
        Since this operation is disrupting, you will be prompted too enter a password to be able to carry it out. There is a hard-coded password
        that you can use initially, and you have the option to change this password for you instance of application. Once you change the
        password, the hard-coded one will no longer be accepted.
    </p>
    <p class="no-space">
        Please note that neither fast nor perpetual PoE are available when 802.3bt is enabled and they are not supported on OS6465, OS6560, or OS6570M.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next is the status of each port on the switch. Port number, PoE status, PoE priority, the power being consumed by the PoE device if any, 
        the Maximum allowed on the port by the hardware (This cannot be increased.  It is fixed in the hardware.), the PoE class and what that means in watts, 
        if the port is running in 2-pair or full 4-pair mode, the device model, device type, and name if available. 
        The PoE device must support LLDP for Model, Device Type, and Device Name to be populated.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that you can hover the mouse over the Device Name (if available) and often discover more information about the 
        connected PoE device when it is functioning properly. Here we see an Axis camera model M20260LE MK II running firmware 9.80.72.  
        The MAC address and IP address are shown.  Again, the device must support LLDP for this feature to function.
    </p>
    <img src="device-info.png" />
    <p>Details on the Status Field and what it means.</p>
    <img src="port-status.png" />
    <p>
        Status may be any of the following: On, Off, Searching, Fault, Deny, Conflict, PoweredOff, NoPoe.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>On: PoE power activation is complete, and the attached device is receiving power.</li>
        <li>Off: PoE has been disabled for this port.</li>
        <li>Searching: PoE is enabled, and the switch is sending PoE probes looking for a device, but activation or class detection is incomplete.</li>
        <li>Fault: PoE activation or class detection has failed.</li>
        <li>Deny: PoE power management has denied power to the port due to priority disconnect or over subscription.</li>
        <li>Test: Port has been forced on and will remain on until it is forced off by RTP functions.</li>
        <li>Conflict: Two PoE ports have been connected and failed to disable PoE on one port.</li>
        <li>NoPoe: Port doesn't support PoE.</li>
    </ul>
    <p id="wizard" class="title">Running the Wizard on a Port</p>
    <p>
        The Wizard attempts to repair a PoE device that is physically connected to an ALE switch but not booting.  
        In this example a 3rd party PoE splitter was connected to port 48 which supplies 802.3bt power and an IP camera that 
        requires 24 volts instead of the normal 48 volts supplied by the switch
    </p>
    <img src="poe-device.png" />
    <p>
        The installer sees that there is no link light on the switch and the Wizard shows port 48 Status as Searching when it should be Up and showing 
        the power being consumed. Select port 48 and click Run PoE Wizard. This is not a camera, AP, or telephone so we select Other and click OK.
    </p>
    <img src="run-wiz.png" />
    <p>
        The Wizard will now attempt to diagnose and repair the problem. This can take up to a full 60 seconds to accomplish.  
        Please be patient while the software runs. The Wizard will report success or not.
    </p>
    <img src="wiz-report.png" />
    <p>
        Note that in this case, capacitor-detection had to be enabled on the switch for the splitter to function correctly. 
        Now we will check port 48 again and will see the Status has changed to Up, it is consuming 3.3 watts of power, 
        is connected to a 95 watt capable port, and negotiated PoE class 8. Everything is good and the remote camera will 
        power up and function correctly. However, because this splitter does not support LLDP, the Wizard can not display 
        any extra information such as name, IP address, or firmware.
    </p>
    <img src="wiz-result.png" />
    <p>Exiting the Application will prompt you to save your changes. Click OK and wait for it to be completed. This can take some time</p>
    <img src="save-prompt.png" />
    <br />
    <img src="save-progress.png" />
    <p id="cfg-wiz" class="header">Configuration Wizard</p>
    <p>
        If you need to reconfigure your switch, starting from scratch and adding some basic recommended setup, 
        you can do so by going to the Configuration menu option.
    </p>
    <img src="config-wiz.png" />
    <p class="topic">Factory Reset</p>
    <p>
        Use this options to reset your switch configuration to factory default. The wizard will completely erase the switch configuration 
        and will set vlan 1 IP inteface with the same IP address you used to connect to the switch originally, so you can reconnect to 
        it with the application after the switch reboots. You can then proceed to run the congif wizard to add some additional configuration.
    </p>
    <p class="no-space">
        Since this operation is disrupting, you will be prompted to enter a password to be able to carry it out. There is a hard-coded password
        that you can use initially, and you have the option to change this password for you instance of application. Once you change the 
        password, the hard-coded one will no longer be accepted.
    </p>
    <p class="topic">Basic Config Wizard</p>
    <p>The wizard presents a few configuration windows, you can navigate back and forth using the "Next >" and "< Back" buttons.</p>
    <p>The first window lets you configure the management IP address and netmask, as well as some switch system parameters</p>
    <img src="cfg-wiz-sys.png" />
    <p>
        Clicking "Next >" will nagivate to the next window where you can configure the Default Gateway, DNS and NTP servers. 
        When NTP option is enabled, you can select the switch's timezone from the drop-down menu.
    </p>
    <img src="cfg-wiz-srv.png" />
    <p>
        Click "Next >" to navigate to the next window, which allows you to configure some features, like Disabling insecure protocols 
        (telnet, ftp) enable SSH, etc.
    </p>
    <p class="no-space">When setting up multicast, you can select which VLANs will have it enabled on the table below the multicast toggle switch.</p>
    <img src="cfg-wiz-feature.png" />
    <p>The last page on the configuration wizard allows you to configure the switch to send SNMP traps to trap receivers</p>
    <img src="cfg-wiz-snmp.png" />
    <p>To add an snmp user, click the "+" button to the left of the table's '"Name" column</p>
    <img src="cfg-wiz-add-user.png" />
    <p>Enter the username and password and click Create</p>
    <p>To delete a user, click the "x" button on the left of the username on the table.</p>
    <p>If you are using SNMP v2, you can create a community by clicking the "+" sign on the Communities table</p>
    <img src="cfg-wiz-add-comm.png" />
    <p>
        Since on the ALE OmniWwitches an SNMP community is associated with a user, enter the community name and select a previously
        created user from the drop-down menu, before clicking Create.
    </p>
    <p>To delete a community, click the "x" button to the left of the community name on the table</p>
    <p>To add an SNMP Trap Receiver, click the "+" button to the left of the Ip Address column on the Trap Receivers table</p>
    <img src="cfg-wiz-recv.png" />
    <p>
        Select the required SNMP Version (v2 or v3) and enter the IP Address of the trap receiver.
        If you selected v2, select the community from the drop-down menu, if you selected v3, select the user from the drop-down menu.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that, to simplify the configuration, the wizard sets the Authentication Protocol as MD5 and the Encryption Protocol 
        as DES, and that's what needs to be configured on the receiver side. The primary key assiciated to the encryption protocol is
        configured the same as the user's password.
    </p>
    <p>
        After your are done with the configuration, click Submit for the wizard to apply the configuration to the OmniSwitch.
    </p>
    <p id="faq" class="header">Frequently Asked Questions</p>
    <p class="title">How do I know if my switch supports PoE?  </p>
    <p>ALE PoE capable switches will have a P in the model number.</p>
    <p class="title">How do I increase the PoE port maximum?</p>
    <p>
        Port maximums are fixed in hardware and cannot be increased, only decreased if desired. Move your PoE device 
        to a high-powered port if required. The wizard will display higher wattage PoE ports and their status for you.
    </p>
    <p class="title">What current ALE switches do not support the new 802.3.bt protocol?</p>
    <p>
        6860E, 6865, and 6465. They support High PoE only. The 4-pair setting must be enabled for any device needing more than 30 watts.
    </p>
    <p class="title">Why isn’t 802.3bt enabled by default?</p>
    <p>
        802.3bt may not be supported on the switch or the correct setting for your network. 
        The PoE Wizard will enable this if needed for you.
    </p>
    <p class="title">Why does the wizard turn PoE off to enable 802.bt?</p>
    <p>The switch must renegotiate with every end device when enabling 802.3bt and the best way to accomplish this is to reset.</p>
    <p class="title">Why does class detection show -? </p>
    <p>802.bt must be supported and enabled on the switch for auto class detection to function correctly.</p>
    <p class="title">How do I accomplish long term monitoring of my ALE network?</p>
    <p>
        The Application is designed to assist with new installations or a major refresh. Long term monitoring of ALE networks 
        is available with our OmniVista Network Management System and plugins for either Milestone or Genetec:

    <p id="std" class="header">PoE Standards</p>
    <p>PoE standards are defined by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and include</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            IEEE 802.3af (PoE)
            <ul>
                <li>Provides up to 15.4 watts of power.</li>
                <li>Delivers power over two pairs of wires (1, 2, 3, and 6) in Cat5 cables and above</li>
                <li>Typically used for devices requiring less power, such as VoIP phones and simple IP cameras.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            IEEE 802.3at (PoE+ or PoE Plus):
            <ul>
                <li>Provides up to 25.5 watts of power.</li>
                <li>
                    Uses all four pairs of wires to deliver power, supporting devices with higher power needs, 
                    such as advanced IP cameras and wireless access points.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            IEEE 802.3bt (PoE++ or 4PPoE):
            <ul>
                <li>Defined in two variations: Type 3 and Type 4.</li>
                <li>Type 3 provides up to 60 watts of power.</li>
                <li>Type 4 provides up to 100 watts of power.</li>
                <li>Supports higher power devices like video conferencing systems, PTZ cameras, and high-end wireless access points.</li>
                <li>Uses all four pairs of wires for power delivery.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p id="hp" class="header">High Power PoE</p>
    <p>
        ALE 6860E and 6865 switches provide intermediate power levels, specifically between 60 and 75 watts. 
        They were designed before the finalization of IEEE 802.3bt standards, cater to devices that require 
        more power than PoE+ but less than the highest levels of PoE++. The 4-pair option must be set to 
        deliver power High PoE, similar to Type 3 and Type 4 and the wizard will set this for you.
    </p>
    <p id="neg" class="header">PoE Detection and Class Negotiation</p>
    <p class="title">PoE Detection</p>
    <p>
        Before delivering power, the switch must ensure that the connected device is PoE-compatible to prevent damage 
        to non-PoE devices. This detection process involves:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Voltage Detection:
            <ul>
                <li>The PoE switch sends a low voltage signal (2.7 to 10.1 volts) to the device over the Ethernet cable.</li>
                <li>The connected device must present a signature resistance (between 19 kΩ and 26.5 kΩ) if it is PoE-compatible.</li>	
                <li>If the signature resistance is detected, the switch proceeds to the next step.</li>	
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Current Measurement:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The switch measures the current response from the device to determine if it falls 
                    within a specific range, confirming the device's compatibility.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            High Resistance Detection:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Some ALE switches can use high resistance detection to identify compatible devices by measuring 
                    higher resistance values, ensuring accurate detection in diverse installation scenarios.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="title">Class Negotiation</p>
    <p>
        Once a device is detected as PoE-compatible, the switch and device negotiate the power class. 
        This process allows the switch to allocate the appropriate amount of power. The classes are defined as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Class 0: Default class (0.44 to 12.95 watts).</li>
        <li>Class 1: Very low power (0.44 to 3.84 watts).</li>
        <li>Class 2: Low power (3.84 to 6.49 watts).</li>
        <li>Class 3: Mid power (6.49 to 12.95 watts).</li>
        <li>Class 4: PoE+ (12.95 to 25.50 watts).</li>
        <li>Classes 5 to 8: Defined in IEEE 802.3bt for higher power levels, supporting up to 100 watts.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="poe-table.png" />
    <p>The Application will display both PoE class and the maximum wattage supported by that class for you.</p>
    <p class="title">Negotiation Process</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Inital Power On:
            <ul>
                <li>The PoE switch starts by providing minimal power to the device.</li>
                <li>The device advertises its class by using a specific load current pattern.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Class Determination:
            <ul>
                <li>The switch detects the advertised class and adjusts the power supply accordingly.</li>
                <li>
                    For higher power levels (PoE++), additional steps may include LLDP 
                    (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) to fine-tune power delivery.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can read more about Power over Ethernet on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet</p>
    <p id="lldp" class="header">Role of LLDP in PoE</p>
    <p>
        The Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) is an industry-standard, vendor-neutral protocol used by network devices 
        to advertise information about themselves to other devices on the same network. This information includes device 
        identification, capabilities, and network policies.
    </p>
    <p class="title">LLDP and PoE</p>
    <p>
        In the context of PoE, LLDP plays a crucial role in enhancing the power negotiation process, particularly for higher power 
        PoE standards (IEEE 802.3at and IEEE 802.3bt). LLDP allows for dynamic and more granular power management through the 
        exchange of detailed power-related information between PoE switches (or injectors) and powered devices (PDs).
    </p>
    <p class="title">Key Aspects ofr LLDP in PoE:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            LLDP enables devices to negotiate power requirements dynamically beyond the initial class-based negotiation. 
            This is especially important for devices that have variable power needs or require more precise power allocation.
        </li>
        <li>
            Using LLDP-MED (Media Endpoint Discovery), a specific extension of LLDP, devices can communicate their exact power 
            requirements and capabilities, allowing the switch to allocate power more accurately and efficiently. 
            See https://www.ieee802.org/1/files/public/docs2006/ab-congdon-lldp-med-8023at-0906.pdf for more information.

    <p class="title">Dynamic Power Allocation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            LLDP allows for real-time adjustments to power allocation based on the device’s current power consumption needs. 
            For example, a device might require more power during certain operations and less during others.
        </li>
        <li>This dynamic allocation helps in optimizing the overall power budget of the PoE switch, ensuring 
            that all connected devices receive the necessary power without over-provisioning.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="title">Power Monitoring and Reporting</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            LLDP provides a mechanism for continuous monitoring and reporting of power consumption. 
            This helps network administrators to manage and troubleshoot power-related issues effectively.
        </li>
        <li>
            With LLDP, the switch can report the actual power delivered to each device, 
            enabling better power management and planning.

    <p class="title">LLDP Process in PoE</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Initialization:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Upon connection, the PoE switch and the powered device exchange LLDP packets containing 
                    detailed information about their power capabilities and requirements.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Negotiation:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The powered device uses LLDP to request a specific amount of power based on its operational needs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The PoE switch assesses its available power budget and responds with the amount of power it can allocate to the device.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Dynamic Adjustment:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If the device's power requirements change (e.g., increased power need due to additional features being activated), 
                    it can send an updated LLDP message to the switch.
                </li>
                <li>
                   The switch then adjusts the power delivery accordingly, ensuring the device receives adequate power without unnecessary allocation.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        By incorporating LLDP into PoE, network devices can achieve more efficient and precise power management, resulting in better 
        overall network performance and reliability. This dynamic and detailed communication protocol ensures that each device gets 
        exactly the power it needs, adapting to changing requirements and optimizing the use of available power resources. 
        The connected PoE device must support these features for them to be of any benefit. 
        You can read more about LLDP on the Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLDP and a nice EE Times tutorial

    <p class="title">lanpower power-over-hdmi</p>
    <p>
        The ALE OS6860E-P24Z8 has a special PoE setting that may be required in rare cases. 
        The Wizard should detect and set this option if needed. Note this feature is restricted to just this switch model and no other.
    </p>
    <p class="title">Capacitor Detection in PoE</p>
    <p>
        Capacitor detection is an alternative method used to detect PoE-compatible devices. Unlike traditional resistive detection, 
        capacitor detection measures the capacitance of the device to determine its compatibility with PoE standards. 
        This method can provide more accurate detection and is useful in environments where resistive detection might be unreliable 
        or less effective. The Wizard will check if this is needed or not for your device.
    </p>
    <p class="title">High Resistance Detection</p>
    <p>
        High resistance detection is used in some PoE systems to identify compatible devices by measuring higher resistance values, 
        however the capability of PSE-to-PSE protection function is reduced when this feature is enabled. Because of the risk of 
        potential damage to equipment, the Wizard will never attempt to configure this setting.  
        Please contact your authorized ALE reseller if you suspect your equipment needs this setting and manually disable PoE 
        on ports that do not have PDs connected BEFORE enabling this feature.
